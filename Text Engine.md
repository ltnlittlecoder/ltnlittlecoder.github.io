This explains how my text engine works. It's quite simple:



### -use **@** symbol to start a new line. So, if you want to write: 


```
hello

 You'll need to type:

```
hello@world*
```



### -use **^** symbol to make next letter a capital. So, if you want to write:

```


 Simple, isn't it?
